Since this is a web site, the client-server architecture was adopted, and in order to relieve the processing load on the Backend, acting as a gateway, a Middleware component was created that is responsible for filtering out requests that should not reach the Backend, e.g. requests for authenticate routes that carry invalid tokens. In addition, the Middleware component is also responsible for sanitizing and validating the payloads of the requests on a technical level, e.g. ensuring that strings meet the minimum size or that requests with excessively large strings do not reach the Backend. 

The Backend, in turn, will be responsible for carrying out all the validation at business level. This component will only accept requests from Midleware and will therefore ignore all requests from other sources. The database that the Backend communicates with is hidden from the outside world, being on a private network. This component is also responsible for communicating with two external APIs in order to fulfill the necessary business flows, in this case the Stripe API and the Twillio API.

Finally, there is the Logs component, which is included in the entire system, as it is responsible for receiving all the actions carried out in the system and thus recording everything according to a standard. In order not to block any part of the system, a message broker was added to the communication, so that actions can be written and read asynchronously.

##### 1.2.2.1.1 Threat Model Information

**Application Version**: 1.0

This website is designed for the travel sector, focusing on facilitating the purchase of stays from customer to customer, emphasizing a peer-to-peer C2C model while excluding commercial entities in this first implementation. The platform supports three distinct user roles:

- Customer
- Property Owners
- System Admins

Property owners will be able to login and have access to features that allows them to register a new property and view the booking history for their listings. Users, on the other hand, can browse through a list of available properties without login, but will be able to login and initiate booking processes, and provide feedback through reviews. System admins will be able to login and play a role in approving reviews and managing the properties submitted to the platform.
